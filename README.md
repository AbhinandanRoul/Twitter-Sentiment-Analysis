# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a program to analyse the tweets and find whether they are associated with positive, negative or neutral sentiment.
This is based on the **TextBlob** library for sentiment classification.

## Use Case-
First, make a twitter dev account to use the code.
Second, input the Hashtag(e.g., #COVID-19), then hit enter.

## Output-
I've analysed-

**No. of words in a tweet**

**No. of positive sentiment**

**No. of negative sentiment**

**No. of neutral sentiment**

**Polarity of each tweet**

**Subjectivity of each tweet**

## Visualisations-

**Plot polarity and subjectivity**

**Plot area graph of counts vs type of sentiment**

**Plot pie chart of percentage of different types of tweets**


Stay tuned for updates...
